# ZAM — Technical Debt & Known Gaps Register

This file replaces the project's prior "zero technical debt" claim with an honest,
tracked register. "Zero debt" was aspirational; the items below are real and named.
Tracking them openly is stronger than asserting their absence.

Status legend: **OPEN** (not started) · **PLANNED** (scheduled in a roadmap phase) ·
**MITIGATED** (partially addressed) · **CLOSED** (resolved, kept for history).

Roadmap phases referenced below are defined in the approved plan
(`groovy-beaming-shannon` — Phase 1a/1b/2/3/4).

| ID | Severity | Title | Status | Target |
|----|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| C1 | High | Core `promptFamily` classifier was a permanent stub | CLOSED | Phase 2a |
| C2 | Medium | Conflict-resolver canonical-rule gaps; unreachable fixture 13 | CLOSED | Phase 2c |
| C3 | Medium | Hand-synced type/default duplication across core↔runtime | CLOSED | a,b,d in 1b-1; c in 1b-2 |
| C4 | High | No version control | CLOSED | Phase 1a |
| C5 | Medium | Non-constant-time API-key compare; thin auth for SaaS | MITIGATED | Phase 1a (+Phase 4) |
| C6 | High | Value is fixture-proven, not field-proven | CLOSED | Phase 3 (offline tier) |
| C7 | Low | Repo hygiene (root scratch/log/generated clutter) | CLOSED | Phase 1a |
| C9 | Medium | Dead no-progress guard (I-5 over-correction) + 2 stale tests | CLOSED | fixed in fix/c9 |
| C10 | Low | Dev-environment: dev-dep advisories + vitest major divergence | CLOSED | vitest→4; audit 0 |
| C-status | Low | Stale `651` test count + `zero tech debt` wording | CLOSED | Phase 1a + CI Phase 2d |

## C1 — Core classifier was a permanent stub (High) — CLOSED (Phase 2a)
`src/core/request-normalizer.ts` used to always return `promptFamily='general_default'`,
`familyConfidence=0.0`, never inspecting the request text — so the core *enforced a policy
given a classification it did not produce*.
**Resolved (docs/33):** a deterministic, offline Request Router (`src/core/request-router.ts`)
now classifies the request text on the no-signals path, **fail-open to `general_default`**.
It asserts a narrowing family only on a strong, unambiguous signal; `simple_greeting` requires
a whole-string greeting; any ambiguity (≥2 families) or weak/no signal → `general_default`.
The `--request-signals` bypass (caller/model tier) is preserved and still takes precedence;
`injectionSuspect` detection remains out of scope (separate future item).
Verified: root suite **757/757** (added classifier + wiring tests; Phase-3 unit tests updated;
all 28 E2E fixtures unaffected — they bypass via `request-signals`); runtime suite **354/354**.

## C2 — Conflict-resolver gaps (Medium) — CLOSED (Phase 2c, option A)
The resolver fell back to `fail_open_unresolved` for four cases the spec (`docs/06` §11.5) already
defined. Investigation found **Case 3 was an actual outcome bug** (resolved to `include` while
emitting a `defer_overrides_omit` warning; spec says defer wins). **Resolved (docs/34):** added four
canonical `resolutionRule` values to `enums.shared.schema.json` + `src/types/conflict.ts` +
`docs/06` §11.3.1a and implemented them in `conflict-resolver.ts`:
- `defer_over_omit` — Case 3 now resolves to **`defer`** (the fix).
- `include_over_omit` — Case 1 (P5), with the include's real path.
- `include_over_defer` — Case 2A.
- `conflict_include_resolved` — single ladder-Step-4 `conflict_include`.
The spurious "unresolved conflict" warnings for these are gone; `fail_open_unresolved` now fires
only for a genuinely unmatched group. **Fixture 13** (`safety-beats-omit`) reaffirmed as an
intended/permanent skip (architecturally unreachable in single-selector MVP; covered by unit test
SHP-1; docs/34 DQ-4). Verified: phase-8 **85/85**; root **757/757**; 28 E2E fixtures unaffected.

## C3 — Hand-synced duplication across boundaries (Medium) — MITIGATED (Phase 1b-1)
The cluster had four items (see `docs/32`):
- **a (CLOSED)** — `AnalyzerOutput` / `ProposalDecision` re-declared in the runtime. Canonical
  definitions moved to `@zam/types` (`packages/types/index.d.ts`), a hand-authored `.d.ts` consumed
  via tsconfig `paths` + `import type` (erased at emit; no install/build/hoist). Core re-exports them.
- **b (CLOSED)** — Class-B defaults triplicated across `api.ts` / `input-loader.ts` / `body-mapper.ts`
  → single source `src/core/class-b-defaults.ts`.
- **d (CLOSED)** — `mergeRegistries` duplicated → single source `packages/runtime/src/merge-registries.ts`.
- **c (CLOSED — Phase 1b-2)** — the fragile `../../../dist/core/api.js` dynamic import in the runtime.
  Implemented DQ-3=A (`import('context-plane')`). Resolution is provided by a workspace-local
  `"context-plane": "file:../.."` dependency in `packages/runtime/package.json` (symlinks the root
  core package into the runtime's `node_modules`). Both `create-agent.ts` and `cli/index.ts` now
  import by package name — no hand-counted relative path remains. The originally-scoped full
  npm-workspaces hoist + `vitest` alignment turned out **unnecessary** for c (the `file:` dep is the
  minimal correct mechanism, since the core is the root package, not a `packages/*` member).

Verified: runtime build + core build green; runtime suite 354/354; the production path smoke-tested
(`createAgent` without an injected planFn loads core via `import('context-plane')`); root 737/737.

## C4 — No version control (High) — CLOSED in Phase 1a
Repo was Google-Drive-synced only. **Resolved:** `git init` + baseline commit; `.gitignore`
hardened (Drive temp dirs, `test-sessions/`); Coder/Reviewer passes now map to branches.

## C5 — Auth security (Medium) — MITIGATED in Phase 1a
`src/http/server.ts` previously used a non-constant-time `provided !== expected` compare.
**Mitigated:** now `timingSafeEqual` over SHA-256 digests (constant-time, length-safe).
**Still open for Phase 4 (any hosted exposure):** single static shared key — no per-consumer
keys, rotation, usage metering, rate limiting, or TLS.

## C6 — Value not field-proven (High) — CLOSED (offline tier; Phase 3)
Previously all evidence was synthetic fixtures with no quantified savings.
**Resolved (docs/35; `benchmarks/`):** a deterministic, offline, no-key token-accounting benchmark
(`npm run benchmark`) compares ZAM's `plan()` against the naive "inject everything" baseline over a
realistic OpenClaw-modeled registry + a 14-request corpus. **Result: 63.9% mean token savings, 0
unsafe omissions, 100% router classification accuracy** (18 components, 5770-token baseline). The
number is conservative (tools are fail-open *included* absent runtime capability info; savings come
from safely omitting the heavy proactive/group/lifecycle scaffolds + non-matching skills + memory).
**Live tier also done (docs/36; `benchmarks/live-run.mjs`):** deterministic-vs-model **classification
agreement 85.7%** (both disagreements on the safe side — the router defaulted where the model
narrowed) and **answer-quality preservation ~80%** (indicative). The value story is now complete:
token savings + structural safety + a deterministic router competitive with a model + preserved
answers. The live tier is key-gated and non-deterministic (manual, not a CI gate).

## C7 — Repo hygiene (Low) — CLOSED in Phase 1a
Removed root clutter (`scratch-*.cjs`, `*_log.txt`, `harness-*.txt`, stray generated
`prompt-plan.json`/`trace.json`/`summary.md`) and added root-anchored `.gitignore` patterns
to prevent recurrence.

## C9 — Dead no-progress guard + 2 stale tests (Medium) — CLOSED (fix/c9)
The `@zam/runtime` package has its own 354-test suite, **not part of the headline 651/735 gates**
(those cover only the root `context-plane` package). It had 2 failing tests; investigation showed
one was a genuine logic defect, not just a stale test:

- **Real defect — dead no-progress guard.** The I-5 fix (`docs/28` §4) made Step 3b require the
  EventStream count to be unchanged too. But `analyzer_completed` + `zam_plan` (+ `error`) events
  append every iteration, so the raw count is *never* unchanged → the plan-hash no-progress guard
  became **unreachable**. I-5 stopped a false-positive by silently disabling the guard (other
  safety nets — max_turns, stuck-detector, tool-call-hash — masked it).
  **Fix (Sam-approved option A):** Step 3b now compares a count of **meaningful** events
  (`tool_result` + `user_message`) instead of the raw count. It fires when the plan repeats *and*
  no new external observation arrived (genuinely stuck), while a real re-entry (new `tool_result`)
  still counts as progress — so the I-5 false-positive does not return. New helper
  `countMeaningfulEvents` in `turn-loop.ts`. The "identical plans" test now passes unmodified.
- **Stale test.** `history-state-builder.test.ts > "should NOT set reentryTurn on first turn"`
  asserted `requestSignals` undefined, but `buildZamInput` intentionally always populates it now
  (docs/25 §7.1). Assertion corrected to check that `reentryTurn` specifically is unset.

**Outcome:** runtime suite **354/354**; root suite **737/737** unchanged. **Follow-up — DONE (Phase 2d):**
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs *all* package suites (root + runtime) + both builds on every
push/PR, so runtime health can no longer go untracked.

## C10 — Dev-environment tooling (Low) — CLOSED (chore/c10-align-vitest)
Surfaced during Phase 1b-2; neither affected shipped/production code. Both resolved:
- **`vitest` major divergence.** `packages/runtime` bumped `vitest ^3.2.0` → `^4.1.9` to match the
  root. Runtime suite passes **354/354** under vitest 4 — the major bump required no test changes.
- **Dev-dependency advisories.** Aligning vitest cleared the vitest-3 chain (5 high → 1); a
  non-breaking `npm audit fix` then patched the remaining `esbuild` dev advisory. `npm audit` now
  reports **0 vulnerabilities** (both full tree and `--omit=dev`). Runtime build + suite re-verified
  green after the fix.

## C-status — Stale claims (Low) — CLOSED (Phase 1a + CI Phase 2d)
Docs quoted `651/651` and "zero technical debt." (Root full suite is now **757/757** after the
Phase-2a classifier/wiring tests; `651` was the Gate-B core subset, phases 0–12.) **Phase 1a**
clarified the status text across README, release notes, and the planner board, and this register
replaced the "zero debt" wording. **Phase 2d** closes it: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` emits the live
root + runtime test counts to the job summary on every run, so the numbers are generated, not
hand-maintained — they can't silently drift again.
